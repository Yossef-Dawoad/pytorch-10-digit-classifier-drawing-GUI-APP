# pytorch-10-digit-drawing-classifier-GUI[APP]
train deep learning model to classifying the first 10 digits 
and then connect this with web design using eel technology 

**Note**: [Required] to run the drawing app folder USE IT with servers 
 CUZ Exports/Imports in JS only work on servers, they DO NOT work on local machines
[use] live sever extension and should be good
