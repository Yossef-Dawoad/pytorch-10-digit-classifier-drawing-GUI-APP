# pytorch-10-digit-classifier-drawing-GUI

training deep learning model to classifying the first 10 digits 
and then connect this with web design(frontend GUI) using eel technology 
to made interactive window btween the user andd the model

### Required installation 
you must install pytorch since it the brain of our application see the documentation about that [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

then run on your command-line the following
```PowerShell
pip install eel 
```

### RUNINNG The Magic
in the directory of the app folder run this on your command-line 
```PowerShell
python main.py
```

### > in the next releases we will have the Next:
 > - ~~frist alpha release~~
 > - ~~implementation of using the trained model to actuall
 testing on unseen data [ones you likelly to draw on the canvas]~~
 > - ~~add choice to have different drawing pen sizes~~
 > - ~~then after all of that working fine the connection between the frontend 
 and backend will be established and they talk to eachother ^_^~~
 
 > - implementing more accurate model improving the accuracy of the current model
 > - adding option to select between those models
 > - imporving the Ui little bt little 
 > - imporving the performance of the app
