# pytorch-10-digit-classifier-drawing-GUI

training deep learning model to classify the first 10 digits 
and then connect this with web design(frontend GUI) using eel technology 
to make an interactive window between the user and the model

### Required installation


> you must install `pytorch` since it the brain of our application see the documentation about that [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

```PowerShell
python main.py
```

###  in the next releases we will have the Next:



 
 > - implementing more accurate model improving the accuracy of the current model
 > - adding an option to select between those models
 > - improving the Ui little bt little
